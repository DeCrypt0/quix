Building QUIX Core

Use the autogen script to prepare the build environment.

    chmod +x autogen.sh
    ./autogen.sh
    chmod +x share/genbuild.sh
    ./configure
    make

Precompiled binaries are available at github, see
https://github.com/quixcoin/quix-binaries

Always verify the signatures and checksums.

See doc/build-*.md for instructions on building quixd,
the intended-for-services, no-graphical-interface, reference
implementation of QUIX.
